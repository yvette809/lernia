**Project structure:**

- Use of the container class on every section to give it an equal margin on both the left and right sides

- Font-family of Roboto was assigned to the body to make the entire webpage have a uniform outlook

- colors are assigned to variables for easy usability
  ex . :root {
  --primaryColor: #36769d;
  }

- Use of bootstrap rows and columns to offer a grid based-layout and display flex to make the elements flexible

- The entie page has a box-sizing property of border-box to prevent the padding to be automatically added to the width and height of the element. Values of magins and paddings were resetted to 0

- The elements are styled accoding to how they are displayed on the html page t.ex the first tag on the HTML page gets to be styled first and so on.

- Project is responsive to different screen sizes
